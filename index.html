            <p><strong>Among Us</strong> is a multiplayer social deduction game developed by InnerSloth, released in 2018. Set in a space-themed environment, players take on one of two roles: <strong>Crewmates</strong> or <strong>Impostors</strong>. While Crewmates work together to complete tasks around the map, Impostors aim to sabotage their efforts and eliminate them without being detected.</p>

            <p>One of the most significant contributions of <strong>Among Us</strong> to popular culture is the term <strong>"sus,"</strong> short for "suspicious." Initially used within the game to accuse players of deceitful behavior, "sus" quickly transcended its original context and became a widely recognized slang term.</p>
